### **Detailed Website Recreation Prompt**

**Role:** You are an expert Full-Stack Web Developer and Senior UI/UX Designer specializing in sleek, modern SaaS landing pages for AI-driven platforms.

**Task:** Create a high-fidelity, responsive single-page landing page for an all-in-one AI creative platform called "[Your App Name]." The design should be inspired by the dark-themed, professional aesthetic of modern AI tools like PXZ.AI.

**1. Design Language & Visual Style:**

* **Theme:** Modern Dark Mode. Use a deep charcoal or black background (`#000000` to `#0d0d0d`).
* **Color Palette:** Use vibrant gradients (electric blue, deep purple, and magenta) for primary buttons and accents.
* **Typography:** Clean, sans-serif fonts (e.g., Inter, Montserrat). Use bold, large headings for impact.
* **Components:** Rounded corners (approx. 12-16px) on all cards, buttons, and image containers. Use subtle borders or slight background-color shifts to differentiate sections.

**2. Structure & Content Sections:**

* **Navigation Bar:** Sticky header with a logo on the left, dropdown menus for "Image Generator," "Video Generator," "Tools," and "Resources," and a prominent "Login" button on the far right.
* **Hero Section (AI Video to Video):**
* Large H1 heading: "AI Video to Video Generator."
* Subtext: Mention turning videos into styles like Pixar, anime, or vintage film while preserving motion.
* Bulleted key benefits (e.g., "Original motion preserved").
* Primary CTA: A bright blue "Try for free" button.
* Visual: A large side-by-side comparison image or video showing a real person next to an AI-generated cartoon version.


* **Featured Tools Section:**
* Create sections for specific high-value tools like an "AI Kissing Generator" or "Consistent Character AI Video."
* Each should have a descriptive title, a short paragraph of text, a "Try for free" CTA, and a supporting image/video asset.


* **The "All-In-One" Platform Pitch:**
* A centered heading: "Start Creating with the All-In-One AI Platform."
* A brief description of how it serves creators and businesses.
* An image or graphic illustrating the workspace.


* **Interactive Tool Grid (Image/Video Effects):**
* A tabbed interface with "Image Effects" and "Video Effects."
* A grid of cards (4 per row on desktop). Each card features a high-quality thumbnail image and a title (e.g., "AI Old Photo Restoration," "Studio Ghibli AI Generator," "Celebrity Selfie Generator").


* **Value Proposition Section ("Why Choose Us"):**
* Three columns with icons and descriptions for:
1. **Subscription Model:** One plan for all tools.
2. **Workflow Automation:** Mention specific efficiency gains (e.g., "60% faster").
3. **Processing Speed:** Highlight sub-30-second task completion.




* **FAQ Section:**
* Accordion-style menu for common questions like data safety and update frequency.


* **Footer:**
* A final "Your AI Powered Workspace Awaits" CTA.
* Columns for "Articles" and "Company" links (Privacy Policy, etc.).
* Contact email, social media icons (IG, X, YouTube, TikTok, FB), and copyright info.



**3. Technical Requirements:**

* **Framework:** Use HTML5 and modern CSS (preferably Tailwind CSS for styling).
* **Responsiveness:** Ensure a mobile-first approach where the grid stacks and the navigation collapses into a hamburger menu.
* **Interactivity:** Include hover states for buttons/cards and simple JavaScript for the tab switching in the tool grid.
